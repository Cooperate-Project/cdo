    <p> This dialog lets you install complete development environments for selected projects, or more exactly <em>project branches</em>,
      on your local disk. You are only four steps away from being able to work on your favorite projects' code: </p>

    <table border="0">

    <p> These buttons in the lower part of the dialog let you control the behaviour of the installer and the results of the installation process:</p>

        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <h3><a name="branches"></a><font color="#194c7f">Check the Project Branches</font></h3>

    <p> In the upper part of the dialog expand the projects you want to work on and check one or more of their branches. Existing installations
      are shown in blue and can be reinstalled. </p>

    <p> <image src="indent.png"><image src="branch-selection.png"></image> </p>

    <h3><a name="versions"></a><font color="#194c7f">Select the Eclipse Versions</font></h3>

    <p> For each installation you can select the Eclipse version you want to use. The availability of the versions can be restricted by the
      selected project branch. By default the highest available version is selected. </p>

    <p> <image src="indent.png"><image src="eclipse-selection.png"></image> </p>

    <h3><a name="folders"></a><font color="#194c7f">Enter the Installation Folders</font></h3>

    <p> The installer enforces a well-defined and recognizable file system structure under the common install folder.
      This structure consists of project folders which contain branch folders. Each branch folder contains a
      separate Eclipse installation which is connected to a single, shared bundle pool.
      The resulting structure can vary slightly depending on the configurations of the installed projects.
      Typically project and branch configurations add folders for workspaces, target platforms, API baselines and so on.</p>

    <p> <image src="indent.png"><image src="filesystem-structure.png"></image> </p>

    <p> By default the <b>install folder</b> is your home folder. You can change it to any location on your disk.
      It is recommended to use short paths without spaces or other characters that may be critical on your platform. </p>

    <p> <image src="indent.png"><image src="install-folder.png"></image> </p>

    <p> By default the <b>bundle pool</b> is located directly under the install folder (see above). You can change it to any location on your disk.
      It is recommended to use short paths without spaces or other characters that may be critical on your platform.</p>

    <p> Keep in mind that the bundle pool allocates quite some space on your disk and significantly speeds up the process of installating the development environments.
      Even if you change the install folder you may want keep the path to an existing bundle pool. </p>

    <p> <image src="indent.png"><image src="bundle-pool.png"></image> </p>

    <p> The aforementioned bundle pool is controlled by a p2 agent, which is located in the 'p2' folder under that bundle pool and
      associates each installation that uses that bundle pool with a profile in the agent's profile registry.
      Some projects provision their target platform with tools such as Buckminster that also make use of a shared bundle pool.</p>

    <p> These target platforms cannot be associated with a p2 agent profile because they are not installations. They require a separate bundle pool.
      By default this <b> target platform bundle pool</b> is located directly under the install folder (see above). You can change it to any location on your disk.
      It is recommended to use short paths without spaces or other characters that may be critical on your platform. </p>

    <h3><a name="install"></a><font color="#194c7f">Start the Installation</font></h3>

    <p> When you have checked the project branches to install, selected the respective eclipse versions and entered the appropriate installation folders
      you may want to edit your <a href="#preferences">user tasks</a> or the <a href="#network">network connection settings</a>. </p>

    <p> Then click the <em>Install</em> button to start the installation process. </p>

    <p> <image src="indent.png"><image src="install-button.png"></image> </p>

    <p> The process starts to install the selected Eclipse versions and the required tools of the checked project branches.
      The progress of the installation process is reported in a popup dialog that shows the setup tasks to be executed in the upper part
      and the installation log in the lower part. The setup task currently being executed is always highlighted. </p>


    <p> <image src="indent.png"><image src="progress-dialog.png" width="450"></image> </p>

    <p> Once an Eclipse IDE is properly installed it is automatocally launched to complete the setup tasks that require to execute <em>within</em>
      that IDE. These tasks are always automatically executed when that IDE starts up but only if they are actually needed. The progress of
      the execution is reported in a popup dialog very similar to the one described above. </p>

    <p> Within the installed IDE you can use the following buttons on the main toolbar: </p>

    <table border="0">
      <tr>
        <td>
          <image src="indent.png"><image src="update.gif"></image>
        </td>
        <td>
          Re-execute all needed setup tasks within the current IDE.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <image src="indent.png"><image src="prefs.gif"></image>
        </td>
        <td>
          <a href="#preferences"> Edit your user tasks. </a>
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <image src="indent.png"><image src="Branch.gif"></image>
        </td>
        <td>
          View the configuration of the current project branch.
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <h3><a name="preferences"></a><font color="#194c7f">Edit the User Tasks</font></h3>

    <p> You can define any number of setup tasks in your <em>user scope</em>. These tasks can optionally be restricted to specific projects or branches.
      All user-scoped tasks that are unrestricted or restricted to the current branch are merged into the list of tasks to be executed when the IDE
      is installed or (re-) configured. </p>

    <p> <image src="indent.png"><image src="edit-preferences.png"></image> </p>

    <p> Refer to the <a href="AuthorsGuide.html">Author's Guide</a> for details about setup authoring tools, the different setup tasks, their properties and how they execute. </p>

    <h3><a name="network"></a><font color="#194c7f">Configure the Network Connections</font></h3>

    <p> Content pending... </p>

    <h3><a name="update"></a><font color="#194c7f">Update the Installer</font></h3>

    <p> When the installer starts it checks for updates in the background. This is indicated by an animated hour glass that overlays
      the disabled <em>Update</em> button at the bottom of the installer dialog. </p>

    <p> <image src="indent.png"><image src="../icons/install_searching0.gif"></image> </p>

    <p> When the update check is finished and if no updates were found the hour glass disappears and the button stays disabled.
      If updates are available the button is enabled. </p>

    <p> <image src="indent.png"><image src="../icons/install_update0.gif"></image> </p>

    <p> If no updates were found the <em>Update</em> button is enabled. Clicking on it starts the update process that, once finished, asks you to restart the installer.</p>

    <p> <b>Please note</b> that the installer may <em>require</em> you to install updates when it loads its configuration files from remote and
      detects that they were created by a newer version of the setup tool.</p>
