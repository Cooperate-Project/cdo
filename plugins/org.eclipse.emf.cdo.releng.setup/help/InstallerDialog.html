<p>
	This dialog installs development environments for any number of project branches on your local disk.
	In the upper part of the dialog expand the projects you want to work on and check one or more of their branches.
	Existing installations are shown in blue. For new installations you can also select the Eclipse version you want to use.
</p>

<p>
    The installer enforces a well-defined and recognizable file system structure
	under the install folder that you need to specify in the lower part of the dialog.
	This structure consists of project folders which contain branch folders. Each branch folder
	contains a separate Eclipse installation which is connected to a single, shared bundle pool.
</p>

<p>
	The resulting structure can vary slightly depending on the configurations of the installed projects.
	Typically project and branch configurations add folders for workspaces, target platforms, API baselines and so on.
</p>

<p>
    The results of the installation can be influenced by user preference tasks.
    Those preferences can be edited using the "Preferences" tool bar button at the bottom of the dialog.
    There's also support for setting your network connection preferences via the "Network connection setup" button.
