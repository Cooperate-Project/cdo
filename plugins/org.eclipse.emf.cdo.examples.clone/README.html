<h1>CDO Clone Server Example</h1>

This project contains the launch configuration "ExampleCloneServer" that
can be used to start a new standalone process with a CDO clone repository.<p>

The clone will connect to a master server that accepts connections on
port 2036 and automatically replicate it whenever it's available.<p>

Make sure that the master repository is configured with ID generation
location CLIENT and auditing, as well as branching!<p>

If the server is running you can point your web browser to
<a href="http://localhost:7778">http://localhost:7778</a> in order to
introspect the repository. Please note that this introspection facility
should not be used in production!<p>
