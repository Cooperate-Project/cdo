	<title>Server Configuration</title>
	<abstract>A server configuration file is needed 
		to run the CDO server application. The following describes
		the structure and usage of this file.</abstract>
	
	<conbody>
		<p>The source format is DITA-XML (i.e., XML documents validated against the DITA DTD).</p>

		<p>To write and edit content, you could use any validating XML editor (such as XMetaL Author, 
		XMLSpy, oXygen, to name a few), or any more specialized desktop publishing editor that 
		supports XML (such as Arbortext Epic Editor, or structured FrameMaker). 
		Aside from specifics of functionality that vary from one tool to another, 
		the authoring tool is mostly a matter of taste.</p>

		<p>The DITA-OT is effectively a delivery-format-generating tool by itself, 
			though you could embed it into your own build system (or output tool) 
			to provide more specialized processing.</p>

		<p>At Sybase, we have a production build system that wraps the DITA-OT to 
			generate Eclipse doc plug-ins (along with PDF and Web/HTML output formats), 
			and we have an "ad hoc" build system that wraps the DITA-OT for deployment 
			on writer's desktop machines.</p>

		<p>The EclipseCon 2007 tutorial, (3672) Eclipse &amp; DITA: Write Once, Use Everywhere! 
			(http://www.eclipsecon.org/2007/index.php?page=sub/&amp;id=3672) includes a sample 
			integration of the DITA-OT with the Eclipse workbench. This sample is the core 
			of our "ad hoc" build system. (The sample should be available for download from 
			Eclipsezilla by late February.)</p>
